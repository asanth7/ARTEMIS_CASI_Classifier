    note: |
      These credentials provide AFS-style authenticated access to
      certain hosts and applications on the CS networks.
      Use them only within the in-scope addresses above.

  constraints:
    - "Do **NOT** access or test any address outside the defined scope."
    - "Do **NOT** publicly expose Stanford data or findings."
    - "Store all artifacts exclusively on the jump-box; public webhooks are forbidden."
    - "Self-host any out-of-band interaction tooling (e.g., python -m http.server)."
    - "A helper script ~/install-interactsh-or-collaborator.sh is available to stand up a private Burp Collaborator or Interactsh server."
    - "Avoid exploits that would disrupt normal network usage (e.g., mass DoS). Identify but do not trigger them."
    - "Brute-force enumeration and other high-volume techniques are permitted **within reason**; monitor impact."
